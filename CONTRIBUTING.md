See the [introductory blog post](https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2019/aug/19/the-story-of-nuxtpress/) to learn about the architectural decisions that are behind NuxtPress, including **_blueprint modules_** which are the mechanism used to register its built-in apps.

Contributing is extremely easy, just pull the [nuxt/press repository](https://github.com/nuxt/press), install NPM dependencies and use the `dev` script to test your changes directly in the bundled examples. If you change something in `src/blueprints/blog`, you'll want to test with your changes with:

```shell
$ npm run dev examples/blog
```
