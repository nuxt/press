# Getting started

**NuxtPress** is a microframework that leverages the [Nuxt module system][1]. It will automatically register routes, templates and configuration options in your Nuxt application, depending on how you configure it. It also takes care of loading Markdown files, rendering them and making the pre-rendered static files available.

[1]: https://nuxtjs.org/guide/modules/

## Setup

Install via [npm](http://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
$ npm install nuxt @nuxt/press
$ yarn add nuxt @nuxt/press
```

Note that you must also install [Nuxt][nuxt] if you haven't already.

[nuxt]: https://nuxtjs.org

## Configuration

First, **NuxtPress** needs to be enabled via `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  modules: ['@nuxt/press']
}
```

This will start NuxtPress in its **default mode**, which enables support for Markdown `pages/`, and automatic full static `nuxt generate` for them.

Bundled apps can also be selectively enabled based on the presence of the `docs/`, `blog/` and `slides/` directories. In **default mode**, the URL prefix for each bundled app matches these directories, .e.g, blog will be able available at `/blog`.

> In a freshly started project, `npm install` (or `yarn add`) will automatically create that `nuxt.config.js` file for you if you haven't already.

Alternatively, you can also do:

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    ['@nuxt/press', '<mode>']
  ]
}
```

This will start NuxtPress in **docs standalone mode**:

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    ['@nuxt/press', 'docs']
  ]
}
```

> That's the only allowed NuxtPress configuration via `nuxt.config.js`. For everything else, use either `nuxt.press.json` or `nuxt.press.js`, covered in the next topic.

In docs standalone mode, there's no URL prefix, so here docs will be available at `/`, not `/docs`, and Markdown files can be placed directly on `<srcDir`>.

Standalone mode works similarly for `blog` and `slides`, as will be shown later.

### Configuration files

You can configure NuxtPress in one of two ways: via `nuxt.press.json`, an autogenerated config file containing most common (JSON-serializable) options, or via `nuxt.press.js`, a full-blown JavaScript configuration file.

> `nuxt.press.js` will always take precedence over `nuxt.press.json`

The `nuxt.press.json` file autogenerated for [this documentation][docs-source] can be seen below. The `nav` key is initially empty and must be filled out.

[docs-source]: https://github.com/nuxt/press/tree/master/demo/docs

```json
{
  "docs": {
    "dir": "docs",
    "prefix": "/",
    "title": "NuxtPress documentation",
    "nav": [
      { "Home": "/" },
      { "Internals": "/internals" },
      { "GitHub": "https://github.com/nuxt/press" }
    ],
    "sidebar": [
      "/",
      "/guide"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Markdown pages

At its core, **NuxtPress** enables you to use Markdown files as [Nuxt pages][np]:

[np]: https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views/#pages

<table>
<tr>
<td><code>pages/index.md</code></td>
<td><code>/</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pages/foo/index.md</code></td>
<td><code>/foo</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pages/foo/bar.md</code></td>
<td><code>/foo/bar</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

Not only will NuxtPress transform Markdown files into working routes, it will also parse YAML metadata via [gray-matter][gm], if available.

Here's a snippet from [`examples/pages`][pages-example]:

[pages-example]: https://github.com/nuxt/press/tree/master/examples/pages

```md
---
someText: hey, this works
someOtherText: hey, this works too
---

# Hello world

Go to [/subpage](/subpage)

Go to [/subpage/other](/subpage/other)

Msg: {{ $press.source.someText }}

Msg: **{{ $press.source.someOtherText }}**
```

You can also use the YAML metadata to specify the [Nuxt layout][nlayout]:

[nlayout]: https://nuxtjs.org/api/pages-layout/

```md
---
layout: yourLayout
---
```
