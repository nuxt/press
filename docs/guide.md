# Guide

**NuxtPress** is a microframework that leverages the [Nuxt module 
system][1]. It includes three apps: a **documentation  suite**, a **blog** and 
a **slideshow** engine that, once enabled, automatically register routes, 
templates and configuration options in your Nuxt application. It also takes 
care of loading Markdown files, rendering them and making the pre-rendered
static files available.

Before moving forward, make sure you've read the [setup instructions][2].

## Enabling modes

The first thing to keep in mind is that **NuxtPress** can be added to and 
seamlessly extend any existing Nuxt application. **A NuxtPress app is a Nuxt 
app**. That said, it won't interfere with existing application functionality.

To add new routes to a Nuxt application, you can use the **`pages/`** folder. 
Nuxt will dynamically build your routes based on the subdirectory hierarchy 
of this folder. In NuxtPress, **you have three new route folders to work with**:
**`docs/`**, **`blog/`** and **`slides/`**. The presence of any of these 
directories in the **`srcDir`** of a Nuxt project will enable their 
corresponding NuxtPress modes. You can customize these directories via 
**`nuxt.config.js`**:

```js
export default {
  press: {
  	docs: {
  	  dir: 'my-custom-docs-dir'
  	},
  	blog: {
  	  dir: 'my-custom-blog-dir'
  	},
  	slides: {
  	  dir: 'my-custom-slides-dir'
  	}
  }
}
```

## Publishing docs

To publish a documentation suite, add your Markdown files to the `docs/` folder.
NuxtPress will automatically detect the presence of a **`README.md`** file or an
**`index.md`** file and make that the *introductory page* of your docs suite.

By default, the documentation suite will be available at the `/docs` route. You
can customize that by setting the `path` configuration property under `docs`:

```js
export default {
  press: {
  	docs: {
      path: '/' // Point / to the docs suite
  	}
  }
}
```

> If all you have is a `nuxt.config.js` file enabling NuxtPress plus a bunch 
> of **`.md`** files in **`srcDir`**, NuxtPress will automatically enable 
> **docs** mode and make the default route `/` without any need for further 
> configuration or subfolders. This is a convenience measure to facilitate 
> using NuxtPress inside existing `docs` folders.

NuxtPress has full support for Markdown.

Check out NuxtPress' own [documentation source][docs-source] for an example.

## Publishing blogs

To publish a blog, add your Markdown files to the `blog/` folder. You can 
structure them in however many subdirectories you want (for grouping posts by
year of publication for, for instance). What determines the publishing date of 
each blog entry is actually their Markdown source header. 

By default, NuxtPress uses a simple format where the first line is parsed out 
as the publication date. **Titles** and **slugs** are automatically generated
from the first heading (`#`) of your Markdown sources:

```
June 20, 2019

# Blog Entry's Title

```

If your Markdown sources however start with a `---`, NuxtPress will try and
parse it via [gray-matter][gm] and will look for `title`, `slug` and `date`.

[gm]: https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter

```markup
---
title: Blog Entry's Title
date: June 20, 2019
slug: blog-entry-slug
---

# This Heading Is Not Used As Title

```

### Adding sidebar links

NuxtPress' default blog template makes it easy to automatically include
sidebar text links, and also includes some predefined SVG icons for common
links like *RSS feed*, *Twitter*, *GitHub* and *LinkedIn*.

```js
export default {
  press: {
    blog: {
      meta: {
        links: [
          {Home: '/blog'},
          {Archive: '/blog/archive'},
          {About: '/blog/about'},
        ],
        icons: [
          {github: 'http://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js'},
          {twitter: 'https://twitter.com/nuxt_js'}
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Currently the **feed**, **twitter**, **github** and **linkedin** icons are available.

You can also completely customize your blog template, and define your very own 
configuration properties and use them in your custom templates.

See more about customization.

## Publishing slides

To publish a slideshow, add your Markdown file to the `slides/` folder.
NuxtPress will parse each slide from Markdown using `#` as the delimiter.

If text follows `#`, it's appended as a `<h1>` tag. If not, it's simply used 
as the delimiter and no `<h1>` tag is added. 

The following example represents four slides:

```markup
My Presentation
(opener, slide 1)

# Slide 2 header

Slide 2 text

#

Slide 3 text
(slide with no header)

# Slide 4 header

Slide 4 text
```

This is a simplification from [MDX][mdx], which uses `---` as delimiter.

## Using components

First list the components in `nuxt.config.js` as follows:

```js
export default {
  press: {
    components: {
      ColorPicker: '@radial-color-picker/vue-color-picker'
    }
  }
}
```

> If needed, you can enable the `sanitize` option for `@nuxt/markdown` globally.

Since NuxtPress operates under the assumption all Markdown is provided by the 
author (and not via third-party user submission), sources are processed in full 
(tags included), with a couple of caveats:

1. Can't use self-closing tags, i.e., **this won't work**:

```markup
<color-picker />
```

But **this will**:

```markup
<color-picker></color-picker>
```

2. When placing Markdown inside a component, it must be preceded and followed
by an empty line, otherwise the whole block is treated as custom HTML.

**This won't work**:

```markup
<div class="note">
*Markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.
</div>
```

But **this will**:

```markup
<div class="note">

*Markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.

</div>
```

As will **this**:

```markup
<span class="note">*Markdown* and <em>HTML</em>.</span>
```

This last example works because `<span>` is not a block-level tag.

> Under the hood, NuxtPress uses [rehype-raw][rehype-raw] for this.
