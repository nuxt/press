# Standalone mode

You've seen briefly how to specify which bundled app should be loaded by passing a mode parameter to the `@nuxt/press` definition in `nuxt.config.js`.

**Standalone mode** basically tells NuxtPress two things:  you're only using **one of the available bundled apps** and the URL prefix for  the URLs generated by the app bundle **should be `/`**, i.e., mixed with those that result from files being placed under the `pages/` directory.

That means if you're running `blog` in **standalone mode**:

```js
export default {
  modules: [
    ['@nuxt/press', 'blog']
  ]
}
```

And you have a `pages/index.vue` file, that is effectively overriding the index blog view. On the other hand, if you have `pages/about.md`, that will be available as `/about` and the blog index will be available at `/`.

Depending on the standalone mode you choose, Markdown files are searched for in different directories, as detailed below:

Standalone mode | Lookup directories
--------------- | ----------------------------------------
`docs`          | `<srcDir>` **or** `<srcDir>/docs`
`blog`          | `<srcDir>/entries` **or** `<srcDir>/posts`
`slides`        | `<srcDir>` **or** `<srcDir>/slides`

You can also set the standalone app via `nuxt.press.json`:

```json
{
  "mode": "slides"
}
```

Or via `nuxt.press.js`:

```js
export default {
  mode: 'slides'
}
```
